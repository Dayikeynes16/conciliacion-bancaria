## Goals

- RFC field for the team:
  when having a team, you should setup the rfc field for the team (optional), because the rfc is the main identifier for the team, when you upload a xml invoice, the rfc emisor should be checked against the rfc of the team, if it matches, the invoice should be assigned to the team, if it doesn't match, the invoice must not be saved and a message should be shown to the user, the message should be something like "The rfc of the invoice doesn't match with the rfc of the team" or "this factura belongs to another team-enterprise", it will be optional because some teams may not have a rfc

- change the position of the filters year/month:
  must remove the year/month filters from the top of the page and place them in another place.

- conciliations rfc consistency:
  when you create a conciliation, you can assing more than one invoice to the conciliation, but all the invoices selected must have the same rfc receptor, because if i select by mistake a invoice made for another enterprise, the conciliation will be wrong, so the conciliation should be made only with invoices made for the same enterprise (rfc receptor)

- change for bank table:
  now, instead of hardcoding the banks formats, we should create a table for banks formats, and when the user uploads a bank movements file, you could create a new bank format row with the columns of the file, and the user can edit the columns to match the bank format in the table, then the user can match the bank movements with the invoices, and the system should save the conciliation, the bank format should have the following columns: date, description, amount, so, when we create a bakn format, we will be able to process payments with that format. for now we only have the format for bbva hardcoded, but we should be able to add more formats in the future, and the user should be able to select the format when uploading the bank movements file, so, when uploading a bank movements, it has a selector, by default it says bbva, but should say "no format" and the banks "if we have a bank format for the bank, we should show it in the selector", if the user must be able to create a new bank format, it should have a button "create new bank format", and it should open a modal to create a new bank format, the modal should have the following fields: name, date, description, amount, so, when we create a bakn format, we will be able to process payments with that format, if the user uploads a bank movements file, and it has a bank format, the system should automatically select the bank format in the selector, and the user should be able to edit the columns to match the bank format in the table, if we upload a bank movements file, and select a bank, the file must match the format saved.
